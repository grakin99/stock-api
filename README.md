# api-assignment

## Technology used

For this project I used moutsache js to handle the templating. however, I implemented it before I realized the node version does not work as intended and I was forced to use the cdn and link it in the index.html, Unfortunate.

I also used the fetch api and ES6 modules to develop this app.

parcel is used to bundle the project on deployment and the dev server.

## How to use

Using this app is simple.

input a valid stock ticker in the input field and then press the "show my the info!" button.

To find information on a new stock just retype in a ticker and click the button once again.

## Installation

for development purposes use `npm run dev`

for production builds use `npm run build`
